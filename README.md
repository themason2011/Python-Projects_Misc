get_fields.py: Reads songs.txt and returns the month, day, and name on each line.

is_palindrome.py: Checks if a string is a palindrome.

minOfTwoLists.py: Returns a list with each element being the smallest element at each index, comparing elements in alist and blist. 
If both elements are the same size in alist and blist, the element from alist is chosen.

recursive_drawings.py: Recursive drawing functions that create a scene with snowflakes and trees.

recursive_funcs.py: Finding the product of two numbers recursively, as well as checking if a string is a palindrome recursively.

recursive_funcs_test.py: Test functions for recursive_funcs.py.

scrabbleWords.py: A series of functions that takes a string of letters and shows what words can be constructed from it.
Also returns the number of points for each word and sorts this list by the number of points earned.

second_smallest.py: Finds the second smallest element in a list.

songs.txt: List off months, days, and names used by get_fields.py.

sum_inputs.py: Finds the sum of two integer inputs.

vowels.py: Finds all the vowels in a word and replaces each vowel with the character "a".

wordlist.txt: List every word in the dictionary. Used by scrabbleWords.py.
